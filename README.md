gift-game
=========
This is the prototype web app for the annual Mattson gift game.  

First, use the "Draw numbers" button to shuffle the participants.  Then, when it's someone's turn, 
click their name and the clock will start to count down.  The name of the person whose turn it is will appear 
under the clock, and the name of the person who is up next will be white.

If someone steals during that turn,  you can reset the clock.  Then when the turn is over, 
click the next person's name.  The person before them will be crossed off the list, they will move under the clock, 
and the next person up will turn white.

Plans for Christmas 2014 include creating a database and a mobile site so that people can follow along 
on their phones from anywhere in the house.
